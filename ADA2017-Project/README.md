# Abstract

A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 

# Dataset
The main dataset we are going to use is *Amazon Reviews*, where we can find the reviews done in Amazon.com from May 1996 to July 2014. Our idea is to use the _reviewerID_ to know about the top reviewers, _asin_ for recognizing products, the _reviewTime_ to know when these reviews are done, the _overall_ score to match it with the top reviewers, products and also with the _helpful_ field to see if there's any relation between scores and helpfulness. 
We plan to enrich this dataset with the *Million Song Dataset*, to check if the Digital Music Category products reviews are related with their popularity from the music dataset by matching the _title_ from the Song Dataset with the _title_ from _metadata_ placed in the Amazon Dataset.


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
We are planning meeting every week for 3 hours to comment our individual progress and check the project. While working on it individually contacting using Mattermost.
Our calendar is going to be the following:
  > **Week 1**: Exploratory analysis of data. Starting notebook with dataframes and fixing data. 

  > **Week 2**: Plotting data to answer our questions.

  > **Week 3**: Analyze information from plots and do some more research on assumptions if needed.
  
  > **Week 4**: Wrapping analysis, check every comment and prepare documentation to submit this second milestone.
