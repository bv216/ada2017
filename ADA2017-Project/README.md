# Title
Analysis of the influence of ratings in Amazon reviews

# Abstract

This project will analyze the influence of popularity on Amazon reviews from different points of views, such as popularity of the reviewer, of the product and of the amount of reviews for the product. To develop it, we are going to use two datasets, the main one is going to be the **Amazon Reviews Dataset** and its ¬-_metadata_, we will also use some small datasets for complementary analysis.
For many buyers, it’s clear that reviews are helpful and take part in their purchase decisions but we wonder who do them, is it just because of the motivation of knowing that you are helping someone? 
These commentary from customers are part of the success of Amazon and our study will let us explore what motivates reviews and which type of buyers get more information from them. 


# Research questions
> **Q1:** How has the amount of reviews changed during time? Is this constant on every category?

> **Q2:** Is there relation between price of the product and the amount of reviews?

> **Q3:** Is there relation between category of the product and the amount of reviews?

> **Q4:** Are the people giving more reviews more satisfied with products?



# Dataset
The main dataset we are going to use is **Amazon Reviews**, where we can find the reviews done in Amazon.com from May 1996 to July 2014. Our idea is to use the _reviewerID_ to know about the top reviewers, _asin_ for recognizing products, the _reviewTime_ to know when these reviews are done, the _overall_ score to match it with the top reviewers, products and also with the _helpful_ field to see if there's any relation between scores and helpfulness. 


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
We are planning meeting every week for 3 hours to comment our individual progress and check the project. While working on it individually contacting by Mattermost.
Our calendar is going to be the following:
  > **Week 1**: Exploratory analysis of data. Starting notebook with dataframes and fixing data. 

  > **Week 2**: Plotting data to answer our questions.

  > **Week 3**: Analyze information from plots and do some more research on assumptions if needed.
  
  > **Week 4**: Wrapping analysis, check every comment and prepare documentation to submit this second milestone.


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 3
We continue with our plans of meeting and for these weeks we are going to do the following:
  > **Week 4**: Fill the notebook prepared from milestone 2.

  > **Week 5**: Finishing analysis and preparing notebooks for week 6.

  > **Week 6**: Create the report, review all information collected upto now and create a great report for Milestone 3.
