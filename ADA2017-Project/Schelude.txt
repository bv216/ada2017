The schedule for the projects is as follows:

Oct. 19, 2017: datasets for projects are announced.
Oct. 31, 2017 (23:59 CET): milestone 1 (10%): the project repo contains a README describing your project idea (title, abstract, questions, dataset, milestones, according to a provided skeleton).
Nov. 28, 2017 (23:59 CET): milestone 2 (20%): the project repo contains a notebook with data collection and descriptive analysis, properly commented, and the notebook ends with a more structured and informed plan for what comes next (all the way to a plan for the presentation). These sections of the notebook should be filled in by milestone 3.
Dec. 19, 2017 (23:59 CET): report (50%): a 4-page PDF document or a data story in a platform of your choice (e.g., a blog post, or directly in GitHub), plus the final notebook (continuation of milestone 2).
Jan. 29-30, 2018: presentation (20%) of posters and (optionally) whatever else tickles your fancy (e.g., on-screen demos); the poster session will take place at the Applied Machine Learning Days at the SwissTech convention center.
Therefore, the bulk of your work should be over before Christmas, in order for you to focus on the exam and presentation (and exams of other classes).
